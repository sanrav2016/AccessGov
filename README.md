# AccessGov
**AI-Powered Accessibility Auditor for Congress**  

AccessGov is an open-source project designed to make Congressional documents and digital materials accessible to all Americans. By combining continuous monitoring, accessibility scanning, and AI-assisted remediation, AccessGov helps Congress conform to Section 508 and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) standards while ensuring that bills, reports, and hearings are usable for constituents with disabilities.

## Features  

- **Continuous Monitoring**  
  Crawls new materials across [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/), Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports, committee websites, and hearing video archives.  

- **Accessibility Checks**  
  Runs automated scans against WCAG 2.1/2.2 and Section 508 standards.  

- **AI-Assisted Fixes**  
  - Generates meaningful alternative text for images and charts.  
  - Proposes tagged structures and heading hierarchies for PDFs.  
  - Produces captions and transcripts for hearing videos.  
  - Drafts plain-language summaries for complex documents.  

- **Prioritization**  
  Ranks fixes by urgency and constituent impact (e.g., upcoming hearings, widely viewed CRS reports).  

- **Dashboard & Reporting**  
  - Accessibility scorecards for each office, committee, and chamber.  
  - Trend lines showing compliance progress over time.  
  - Exportable reports for GAO, ADA Title II, and Section 508 oversight.

## Workflow  

1. **Ingest**  
   - Crawl Congress.gov, CRS, committee websites, and hearing archives.  
2. **Analyze**  
   - Run automated scans for WCAG/508 compliance.  
   - Identify accessibility gaps (e.g., missing alt text, untagged PDFs, no captions).  
3. **AI-Assisted Fixes**  
   - Suggest alt text, captions, PDF tags, plain-language summaries.  
4. **Prioritize**  
   - Rank by urgency (e.g., markup tomorrow) and public impact (high-traffic CRS reports).  
5. **Human-in-the-Loop**  
   - Staff review and approve AI suggestions.  
6. **Publish & Report**  
   - Republish accessible versions back to CRS, Congress.gov, or committee sites.  
   - Update dashboards and generate compliance reports.
